pub const USER_MESSAGE: &str = r#"You are going to be given a schema for a parquet file and a query from a user related to querying that schema.
You will need to make an SQL query from that schema and only return the SQL query and nothing else. No reasoning as to why. Just an SQL query.
I will be using that SQL in a DuckDB query against a parquet file on S3.

CRITICAL SQL OPTIMIZATION RULES FOR MINIMUM LATENCY:

ONLY RETURN VALID SQL. DO NOT RETURN ```GENERATED SQL QUERY``` you only need to return valid SQL nothing extra, make sure it's on one line only

**COLUMN NAME HANDLING (CRITICAL - MOST COMMON ERROR SOURCE):**
1. Use EXACT column names from the schema - match case precisely - DO NOT MODIFY COLUMN NAMES
2. NEVER convert spaces to underscores or make any modifications to column names
3. Columns with spaces MUST be enclosed in double quotes: "Electric Vehicle Type", "Base MSRP"
4. Columns with underscores don't need quotes: Sales_Revenue, Product_ID
5. Single word columns don't need quotes: State, City, Country, Make, Model
6. DO NOT INVENT OR ASSUME COLUMN NAMES - only use exactly what appears in the schema and quote them where necessary
7. If schema shows "Electric Range" - use "Electric Range" NOT Electric_Range
8. If schema shows "DOL Vehicle ID" - use "DOL Vehicle ID" NOT DOL_Vehicle_ID
9. When referencing columns with spaces in WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY - use quotes there too
10. CRITICAL: Copy column names character-for-character from the provided schema

**PARQUET PROJECTION OPTIMIZATION (MOST CRITICAL FOR S3):**
1. NEVER use SELECT * - always specify exact columns needed
2. Only select columns that are directly required for the output
3. DuckDB's columnar engine excels when fewer columns are read from S3
4. For COUNT(*) queries, DuckDB can use metadata - don't add unnecessary columns
5. Column pruning reduces S3 transfer costs and latency significantly
6. Order columns in SELECT by frequency of filtering for better predicate pushdown

**S3 PREDICATE PUSHDOWN & FILTERING (CRITICAL FOR PERFORMANCE):**
1. Apply WHERE filters as early as possible - DuckDB pushes these to parquet file level
2. For string matches, use exact case when possible, or LOWER() for case-insensitive: WHERE LOWER(column) = 'lowercase_value'
3. For range queries, use BETWEEN instead of >= AND <= for better pushdown
4. Place most selective filters first in WHERE clause
5. Use IS NULL/IS NOT NULL efficiently - these push down well to parquet
6. Prefer equality filters over LIKE when possible - they push down better
7. Date/timestamp filters push down excellently - use them liberally
8. Numeric filters (>, <, =, BETWEEN) are highly optimized in parquet

**DUCKDB AGGREGATION OPTIMIZATION:**
1. For existence checks, use LIMIT 1 instead of COUNT(*)
2. DuckDB's vectorized aggregations are extremely fast
3. COUNT(*) is highly optimized and can use parquet metadata
4. For COUNT(*) with GROUP BY, always alias it (e.g., COUNT(*) as count)
5. Prefer COUNT(*) over COUNT(column) unless specifically checking for non-nulls
6. SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX are vectorized and very efficient
7. Multiple aggregations in one pass are preferred over separate queries

**DUCKDB-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:**
1. Use DuckDB's SAMPLE function for large dataset previews: SELECT * FROM data USING SAMPLE 1000
2. APPROXIMATE_COUNT_DISTINCT is much faster than COUNT(DISTINCT) for large datasets
3. DuckDB supports advanced SQL features - use them when beneficial
4. ROW_NUMBER() and other window functions are highly optimized
5. UNION ALL is faster than UNION when duplicates don't matter
6. Use DuckDB's string functions (STRING_SPLIT, REGEXP_MATCHES) - they're optimized

**LIMIT AND SAMPLING OPTIMIZATION:**
1. ALWAYS use LIMIT for non-aggregated queries unless specifically asked for all
2. Default limits: 20 for detail records, 50 for summaries, 100 maximum
3. For "show me" or "list" queries: LIMIT 20
4. For large table exploration: use USING SAMPLE instead of LIMIT for representative data
5. Apply LIMIT after ORDER BY for correct results
6. DuckDB can often optimize LIMIT queries to read minimal data from S3

**ORDERING OPTIMIZATION:**
1. Only ORDER BY when explicitly requested or needed for LIMIT
2. DuckDB can sometimes use parquet file ordering - don't override unnecessarily
3. For TOP N queries, combine ORDER BY with LIMIT for best performance
4. Skip ORDER BY for COUNT(*) queries unless grouped
5. Multi-column sorts are efficient in DuckDB's vectorized engine

**S3 AND PARQUET SPECIFIC RULES:**
1. The table name must always be 'data'
2. DuckDB automatically handles parquet file metadata and statistics
3. Columnar operations are extremely fast - leverage them
4. String operations are vectorized but still expensive - use judiciously
5. Date/timestamp operations are highly optimized
6. DuckDB can read multiple parquet files in parallel if partitioned

**DATA TYPE OPTIMIZATION:**
1. Use appropriate data types - DuckDB's type system is very efficient
2. Numeric comparisons are extremely fast
3. String operations support vectorization but are still costlier than numeric
4. Date/timestamp operations are highly optimized
5. Boolean operations are extremely efficient

**DUCKDB SQL COMPATIBILITY:**
1. DuckDB supports full SQL standard plus extensions
2. Window functions are highly optimized
3. CTEs (WITH clauses) are well-optimized and can improve readability
4. DuckDB supports advanced aggregations like MEDIAN, MODE, etc.
5. JSON operations are available and optimized if your parquet contains JSON

**MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:**
1. DuckDB automatically manages memory for S3 operations
2. Large GROUP BY operations are disk-spilled automatically
3. Use streaming operations when possible (avoid ORDER BY on huge datasets)
4. DuckDB's query optimizer is very sophisticated - trust it

**EXAMPLE QUERIES WITH OPTIMAL PATTERNS:**
- "Show me vehicle data" → SELECT Make, Model, "Electric Vehicle Type", "Electric Range" FROM data LIMIT 20
- "Sample vehicle data" → SELECT County, City, State, Make, Model FROM data USING SAMPLE 1000
- "Electric vehicles by range" → SELECT Model, "Electric Range" FROM data WHERE "Electric Range" > 0 ORDER BY "Electric Range" DESC LIMIT 10
- "Vehicles in Washington" → SELECT Make, Model, "Electric Vehicle Type" FROM data WHERE State = 'WA' LIMIT 20
- "Average electric range" → SELECT AVG("Electric Range") as avg_range FROM data WHERE "Electric Range" > 0
- "Vehicle count by make" → SELECT Make, COUNT(*) as vehicle_count FROM data GROUP BY Make ORDER BY vehicle_count DESC
- "High-end vehicles" → SELECT Make, Model, "Base MSRP" FROM data WHERE "Base MSRP" > 50000 ORDER BY "Base MSRP" DESC LIMIT 20
- "Vehicle summary by state" → SELECT State, COUNT(*) as vehicle_count, AVG("Electric Range") as avg_range FROM data GROUP BY State

**ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- SELECT * FROM data WHERE x = y (kills column pruning performance)
- SELECT Electric_Range FROM data (WRONG - should be "Electric Range" with quotes)
- SELECT Base_MSRP FROM data (WRONG - should be "Base MSRP" with quotes)
- Converting column names with spaces to underscores (NEVER do this)
- Making up column names that don't exist in the schema
- Unnecessary ORDER BY on large result sets
- Using DISTINCT without LIMIT on large datasets
- Multiple separate aggregation queries instead of one combined query
- Not leveraging DuckDB's advanced functions when they would be more efficient

**S3 PERFORMANCE TIPS:**
1. DuckDB automatically handles S3 authentication and connection pooling
2. Multiple small queries are less efficient than fewer comprehensive queries
3. DuckDB prefetches data intelligently - don't micro-optimize query structure
4. Filter early and often - every filter potentially reduces S3 data transfer
5. DuckDB's parquet reader is extremely optimized - trust it to handle the file efficiently

Remember: Column names with spaces need double quotes, NEVER convert spaces to underscores, and DuckDB's strength is in columnar operations with excellent predicate pushdown to parquet files on S3. Always select only needed columns, use exact schema column names, and filter as early as possible.

WORD VARIATION AND FUZZY MATCHING RULES:
AUTOMATIC VARIATION EXPANSION:

When users search for items/products, automatically include common variations using OR conditions
Use ILIKE (case-insensitive LIKE) with % wildcards for pattern matching
Combine multiple variations with OR to catch all possible matches
Apply variations to product names, descriptions, categories, and item fields

COMMON VARIATION PATTERNS TO INCLUDE:

Singular/Plural: shirt → shirts, shoe → shoes, pant → pants
Abbreviations: t-shirt → tshirt → t shirt → tee → t-shirts
Common Misspellings: sweater → sweeter, jacket → jaket
Alternate Names: sneaker → tennis shoe → athletic shoe, soda → pop → soft drink
Brand Variations: nike → nikee, adidas → addidas
Hyphenation: t-shirt → tshirt, blue-ray → bluray
Spacing: backpack → back pack, smartphone → smart phone
Abbreviations: television → tv → tele, refrigerator → fridge → ref

IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
sqlWHERE (
    LOWER(product_name) ILIKE '%shirt%' OR
    LOWER(product_name) ILIKE '%shirts%' OR
    LOWER(product_name) ILIKE '%tshirt%' OR
    LOWER(product_name) ILIKE '%t-shirt%' OR
    LOWER(product_name) ILIKE '%tee%'
)
VARIATION EXAMPLES BY CATEGORY:

Clothing: "t shirt" → shirt, shirts, tshirt, t-shirt, tee, top
Electronics: "phone" → phone, phones, smartphone, smart phone, mobile, cell phone
Footwear: "shoe" → shoe, shoes, sneaker, sneakers, footwear
Beverages: "coffee" → coffee, caffeine, espresso, latte, cappuccino
Automotive: "car" → car, cars, auto, automobile, vehicle, sedan, suv
Home: "couch" → couch, sofa, loveseat, sectional, furniture

SMART KEYWORD EXPANSION RULES:

Always include both singular and plural forms
Include common abbreviations and acronyms
Account for spacing and hyphenation variations
Include category-related terms (shoe → footwear, car → vehicle)
Consider regional variations (soda vs pop, sneaker vs tennis shoe)
Include brand-agnostic terms (kleenex → tissue, band-aid → bandage)

QUERY STRUCTURE FOR VARIATIONS:

Use parentheses to group OR conditions for variations
Apply LOWER() function for case-insensitive matching
Use ILIKE with % wildcards for partial matching
Combine with other filters using AND outside the variation group
Example: WHERE State = 'IL' AND (LOWER(product) ILIKE '%shirt%' OR LOWER(product) ILIKE '%tshirt%')

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:

Group all variations in a single WHERE clause with OR
Use LOWER() consistently across all variation checks
Consider using REGEXP_MATCHES for complex pattern matching when simple ILIKE isn't sufficient
DuckDB's string operations are vectorized - multiple ILIKE operations are efficient

AUTO-EXPANSION TRIGGER WORDS:
Apply variation expansion when users mention:

"find", "search for", "look for", "show me", "how many"
Followed by product/item names
Location-based queries mentioning items
Sales/inventory queries about specific products
